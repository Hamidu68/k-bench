Roadmap:

Control plane
     1. Support for tracking events and latencies across CRDs like VMs (WIP)

Data plane
     
     1. Like we have workloads to stress Compute, memory, I/O, network components, we should also include workloads to stress accelerators like GPUs from K8s
     2. Include workloads with most common network patterns between pods, like mesh etc
